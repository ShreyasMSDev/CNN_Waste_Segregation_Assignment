# CNN_Waste_Segregation_Assignment

## **Problem Statement**

Improper waste disposal contributes to environmental degradation, increased landfill waste and inefficient recycling processes. Manual sorting is labour-intensive, error-prone and costly. An AI-powered waste classification system addresses these challenges by streamlining waste segregation, reducing operational costs and improving recycling rates.
 

## **Objective**

The objective of this project is to implement an effective waste material segregation system using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that categorises waste into distinct groups. This process enhances recycling efficiency, minimises environmental pollution, and promotes sustainable waste management practices.

## **The key goals are:**

* Accurately classify waste materials into categories like cardboard, glass, paper, and plastic.
* Improve waste segregation efficiency to support recycling and reduce landfill waste.
* Understand the properties of different waste materials to optimise sorting methods for sustainability.

## **Key business benefits include:**

- Automated waste sorting, cutting time and labour
- Increased recycling rated by precise classification of recyclables

## **Use Cases:**
- Smart Recycling Bins
- Automated Waste Sorting Facilities
- Waste Monitoring and Reporting
